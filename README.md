### Project Structure

- `api.js`: Handles data fetching from the OpenWeatherMap API and generates request URLs.
- `app.js`: Integrates search functionality with the API, updates weather data on the UI, and displays fetched information.
- `module.js`: Provides utility functions for formatting dates, times, and handling air quality index descriptions.
- `route.js`: Manages routing for different locations (current location or searched location) and updates the URL hash accordingly.
